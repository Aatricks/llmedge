# llmedge
Library for using gguf models on android devices, powered by llama.cpp

## Setup

1. Clone the repository with its submodule originating from llama.cpp,

```commandline
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Aatricks/llmedge
cd SmolChat-Android
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. Android Studio starts building the project automatically. If not, select **Build > Rebuild Project** to start a project build.

3. After a successful project build, [connect an Android device](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device) to your system. Once connected, the name of the device must be visible in top menu-bar in Android Studio.

## Working

1. The application uses llama.cpp to load and execute GGUF models. As llama.cpp is written in pure C/C++, it is easy 
   to compile on Android-based targets using the [NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk). 

2. The `smollm` module uses a `llm_inference.cpp` class which interacts with llama.cpp's C-style API to execute the 
   GGUF model and a JNI binding `smollm.cpp`. Check the [C++ source files here](https://github.com/shubham0204/SmolChat-Android/tree/main/smollm/src/main/cpp). On the Kotlin side, the [`SmolLM`](https://github.com/shubham0204/SmolChat-Android/blob/main/smollm/src/main/java/io/shubham0204/smollm/SmolLM.kt) class provides 
   the required methods to interact with the JNI (C++ side) bindings.

## Technologies

* [ggerganov/llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) is a pure C/C++ framework to execute machine learning 
  models on multiple execution backends. It provides a primitive C-style API to interact with LLMs 
  converted to the [GGUF format](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/blob/master/docs/gguf.md) native to [ggml](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml)/llama.cpp. The app uses JNI bindings to interact with a small class `smollm.
  cpp` which uses llama.cpp to load and execute GGUF models.
